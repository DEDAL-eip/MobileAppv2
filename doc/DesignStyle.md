### User personas  

### Design principles 

1. Consistency:  
One of the primary design principles of the DEDAL app style is consistency.  
This means that the app uses a consistent visual language across all of its pages and features.  
This consistency helps users to navigate the app more easily and creates a sense of familiarity and coherence.  

2. Simplicity:
The DEDAL app style also emphasizes simplicity.  
This means that the app is designed with a clean and uncluttered interface that is easy to use and understand.  
This simplicity helps users to focus on the content and features that matter most to them, without being distracted by unnecessary design elements.

3. Hierarchy:
Another key design principle of the DEDAL app style is hierarchy.  
This means that the app uses visual cues such as color, typography, and spacing to create a clear hierarchy of information.  
This helps users to quickly identify the most important content and features, and makes it easier for them to find what they are looking for.

4. Personalization:
The DEDAL app style is also designed with personalization in mind.  
This means that the app uses data and insights to personalize the user experience for each individual user.  
This personalization can include things like customized recommendations, personalized playlists, and tailored content based on the user's listening history and preferences.

5. Branding:
Finally, the DEDAL app style is designed with branding in mind.  
This means that the app uses a consistent visual identity across all of its pages and features, including the use of the DEDAL logo, colors, typography, and iconography.  
This branding helps to establish a clear and recognizable identity for the app, and makes it more memorable for users.

## Visual Design

### Color palette, typography, and iconography  
Color Palette:

    dedalBlue : '#294F87',
    dedalBlueDisable : '#70819c',
    ErrorRed : '#FF0000',
    White : '#FFFFFF',
    Black : '#1D1D1D'

Typography:

    Main: 'Raleway-Light.ttf',
    Bold: 'Raleway-Black.ttf'

Iconography:

    @expo/vector-icons: 'Feather'

The color palette, typography, and iconography used in the DEDAL application style are designed to be modern, minimalistic, and easy to understand.  
The use of a consistent color and font family helps to create a cohesive and recognizable brand identity, while the custom icons provide a unique and memorable visual language.

### Visual hierarchy  

1. Use typography to create hierarchy:  
The DEDAL application style uses typography to create a clear hierarchy of information.  
Headlines are typically set in a larger and bolder font, while body copy is set in a smaller and lighter font.  
This helps to guide the user's eye and emphasize the most important information on the page.

2. Use color strategically:  
Color is also used in the DEDAL application style to create visual hierarchy.  
The primary green color is used for buttons, links, and other interactive elements, while black and gray are used for text and other interface elements.  
By using color consistently and strategically, the design creates a clear visual hierarchy and helps to draw the user's attention to the most important elements on the page.

3. Use whitespace to create separation:  
Whitespace is used in the DEDAL application style to create separation between different elements on the page.  
By using whitespace strategically, the design creates a sense of balance and helps to make the content more legible and easy to scan.

4. Use imagery to create visual interest:  
Imagery is also used in the DEDAL application style to create visual interest and break up large blocks of text.  
Images are often used to accompany articles, playlists, and other content, and are carefully selected to align with the overall brand identity and style.

5. Use a consistent layout:  
The DEDAL application style uses a consistent layout across different pages and sections of the application.  
This helps to create a sense of familiarity and predictability for the user, which can enhance the overall user experience.  
The layout is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that the content is always presented in a clear and legible way.

The guidelines for creating visual hierarchy and organizing content on the page in the DEDAL application style emphasize simplicity, consistency, and clarity.  
By using typography, color, whitespace, and a consistent layout, the design creates a cohesive and intuitive user experience that is easy to use and understand.

## Layout and Grid System

### Grid system  

1. Column Widths:  
The 12-column grid is based on a fixed container width of 1200px.  
Each column has a width of 60px, and gutters (the space between columns) are 30px wide.

2. Responsive Design:  
The grid is designed to be flexible and responsive, meaning that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.  
The columns can be rearranged and stacked as needed to create layouts that work well on smaller screens.

3. Alignment:  
The grid helps to establish consistent alignment across the page by dividing it into sections and aligning elements to those sections.  
Elements are typically aligned to the left or right edge of the section, or centered within the section.

4. Proportional Spacing:  
The grid also helps to create proportional spacing between elements.  
For example, elements that are aligned to the left or right edge of a section will typically have a margin of 60px (the width of one column) between them and the edge of the section.

5. Modular Design:  
The grid is used to create modular layouts that can be easily repeated and combined to create complex pages.  
This modular approach helps to ensure consistency across the application and makes it easier to maintain and update the design over time.

Tthe grid system in the DEDAL app style is a key element in creating consistent and balanced layouts that help to establish visual hierarchy and organize content effectively.  
By defining the placement and spacing of page elements, the grid helps to create a cohesive and user-friendly experience for DEDAL users.
