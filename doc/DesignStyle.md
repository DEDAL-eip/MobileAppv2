## Introduction

### Design goals
1. Create a cohesive and consistent brand identity:  
One of the primary design goals for the DEDAL app style is to create a strong and recognizable brand identity.  
This is achieved through the consistent use of colors, typography, and iconography throughout the application.  
By maintaining a consistent design language, the DEDAL app style helps to establish a clear brand identity and make the application more memorable for users.

2. Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface:  
Another important design goal for the DEDAL app style is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  
This is achieved through the use of clear and simple layouts, typography, and iconography, as well as through the use of whitespace and color to create visual hierarchy.  
The goal is to make it easy for users to find the content they are looking for and to make it simple for them to navigate the application.

3. Promote engagement and discovery:  
A key design goal for the DEDAL app style is to promote engagement and discovery among users.  
This is achieved through the use of visually interesting imagery and the integration of social sharing features.  
By making it easy for users to discover new music and share their favorite content with others, the DEDAL app style helps to create a sense of community and encourages users to engage with the application on a regular basis.

4. Ensure scalability and responsiveness:  
The DEDAL app style is designed to be scalable and responsive, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices without sacrificing usability or functionality.  
This is achieved through the use of flexible layouts, responsive typography, and dynamic imagery.  
The goal is to make the application accessible to as many users as possible and to ensure that it works equally well on desktop and mobile devices.

The design goals for the DEDAL app style emphasize simplicity, consistency, and engagement. By creating a strong and recognizable brand identity, promoting an intuitive and user-friendly interface, and ensuring scalability and responsiveness, the DEDAL app style is able to create a unique and memorable user experience that keeps users coming back for more.

## Visual Design

### Color palette, typography, and iconography  
Color Palette:

    dedalBlue : '#294F87',
    dedalBlueDisable : '#70819c',
    ErrorRed : '#FF0000',
    White : '#FFFFFF',
    Black : '#1D1D1D'

Typography:

    Main: 'Raleway-Light.ttf',
    Bold: 'Raleway-Black.ttf'

Iconography:

    @expo/vector-icons: 'Feather'

Overall, the color palette, typography, and iconography used in the DEDAL application style are designed to be modern, minimalistic, and easy to understand.  
The use of a consistent color and font family helps to create a cohesive and recognizable brand identity, while the custom icons provide a unique and memorable visual language.

### Visual hierarchy  

1. Use typography to create hierarchy:  
The DEDAL application style uses typography to create a clear hierarchy of information.  
Headlines are typically set in a larger and bolder font, while body copy is set in a smaller and lighter font.  
This helps to guide the user's eye and emphasize the most important information on the page.

2. Use color strategically:  
Color is also used in the DEDAL application style to create visual hierarchy.  
The primary green color is used for buttons, links, and other interactive elements, while black and gray are used for text and other interface elements.  
By using color consistently and strategically, the design creates a clear visual hierarchy and helps to draw the user's attention to the most important elements on the page.

3. Use whitespace to create separation:  
Whitespace is used in the DEDAL application style to create separation between different elements on the page.  
By using whitespace strategically, the design creates a sense of balance and helps to make the content more legible and easy to scan.

4. Use imagery to create visual interest:  
Imagery is also used in the DEDAL application style to create visual interest and break up large blocks of text.  
Images are often used to accompany articles, playlists, and other content, and are carefully selected to align with the overall brand identity and style.

5. Use a consistent layout:  
The DEDAL application style uses a consistent layout across different pages and sections of the application.  
This helps to create a sense of familiarity and predictability for the user, which can enhance the overall user experience.  
The layout is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that the content is always presented in a clear and legible way.

Overall, the guidelines for creating visual hierarchy and organizing content on the page in the DEDAL application style emphasize simplicity, consistency, and clarity. 
By using typography, color, whitespace, imagery, and a consistent layout, the design creates a cohesive and intuitive user experience that is easy to use and understand.
