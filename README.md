- Make the "Remember me" button have the blue color DEDAL  

### to redo:
- Redo the instances of "Home" in "Map" because more explicit

- Redo the bottom bar to follow the Figma model
- Redo the CStyle because each file has different standards
- Redo the CSS because multiple style files  

### to check:
